# CC-WebApp
This application was part of my master thesis at EC Utbildning. 
I developed this app to showcase my knowledge in full stack development as well as creating a simple website for my previous employer.
I used .NET MVC and a login functionality from Auth0, making it possible for the end user to login with a google account.
